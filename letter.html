Oh my God it's been a fucking year now since your last birthday. <br>
Ah okay<br>
<br><br>
SOO...how am I supposed to do this lmao<br>
Okay well. <br>
<br><br>
HELLO YOU.</p> <br>     <div class="image-container">
                <img src="joe.png" class="letter-image">

<p class="letter-text"> Time has a way of slipping by, doesn't it? <br> How tf are here we are again? Your birthday wasn't too long ago, feels like "are abhi to Anushka ka birthday tha"
Damn. 

<br><br>
You probably didn‚Äôt expect this, right? Or maybe you did. <br> I mean ofcourse you did. <br>A letter. <br>Not just any letter. <br> Or maybe just another letter, who knows?

But it's something, going to be about more than just a years worth of thoughts, some we shared, some bottled up, some still hidden, too much mystry ey? I mean, it‚Äôs not every day I sit down, trying to articulate all of this, or maybe I would if it was last year, it was different back then, writing this is kind of overwhelming, my negativity kills me and eats all of me each day, but I will try and not let this chance go wasted, I really wanted to, not since a week, or a month or two but since the very exact day you turned 15, and damn I have been waiting for this. 
<br>
But it kinda sucks, sucks in a way how things have changed so much and I don't feel that freedom anymore and perhaps I don't even feel a mouth that has the right to express what I had wanted to for so long, things I wanted to earn the right to tell you. <br>
But hey, it's okay, I promised u right? I know I suck at promises but for today, I can go smoothly with the "One form to another"<br>
And afterall, as you once said,
            <p class="quote"> ‡§ï‡•Å‡§õ ‡§¨‡§æ‡§§‡•á‡§Ç ‡§Ö‡§ß‡•Ç‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§π‡•Ä ‡§∏‡§π‡•Ä.. </p> <br>
So it's all okay (ofc it's okay I'm telling myself it's okay ü´†) <br><br>


I'm really confused on how to start with this, feels weird and overwhelming, there are so many thoughts yet I'm able to write none, maybe let's start from the very fucking start, why don't we? <br> (Bro won't stop acting as if he's in a YouTube video)
<br><br>
Oh boy, so 2022 it is, 2 years ago.<br>
We don't even know each other, all I know about you is that "Since when and how did Ayushi start looking this healthy and beautiful" <br> like seriously that was my first thought as you already know. <br> The first interaction I had 
            with you was on your 14th birthday actually, <br> I wished u happy birthday that day, we went to that school trip to sun temple, and I think that was it? 2022 me humlog kahan zada baat kiye the, <br> but I love how my first interaction with you was on your birthday lmao.
<br><br>
So that means today is not just YOUR BIRTHDAY but also the 2nd anniversary of us knowing eachother, god damn I realised this so fucking late wow. 
<br><br>
<div class="poem"> A Happy Birthday to YOU and a Happy 2nd anniversary to us.<br>(Hope that's a happy thing) </div>
<br><br>
Yk sometimes I be sitting around and come to a sudden realisation every once a while. It's like "damn, she's not here" "If she would have been here it would have been like this this........."<br>
I have lost so much :_), so much of you and so much of me as well and ig there is no getting back which is fine but damn, I have lost so much.<br>
You saturated me yk, I was stable with you, like alkanes who don't need much of themselves, as for them hydrogen is enough. <br> You were enough for me,<br>nothing more,<br>nothing less,<br>living when you were there was easy,<br>studying when you were there was easy,<br>life was easy,<br>when you were there the problems didn't matter,<br>you always took the highlight and made my problems feel nothing,<br>you were like home. 
<br><br>

            <div class="poem">
I was with you,<br>
and for the first time, I existed,<br>
beyond the air in my lungs, and the blood in my veins. </div>

<br><br>
These sudden realisations are enough to give me small seizures.
<br><br>
Who knows what's coming next? Hate to say it but maybe one day, something or someone else will bring me the fullfilment I'm searching for, though I wouldn't prefer it be another person now. But yeah, life is just, like this endless cycle of finding fulfilment, only to loose it again
<br><br>
I wrote this dramatic thing while I was in the bus, sitting alone going home from bridgeford. It's very raw and ik how stupid I am for this ok

<div class="poem"> 
    It's that time of the month again,<br>
The month I thought I had lost something I needed.<br>
But maybe I didn't need any part of it,<br>
It didn't matter‚Äîbecause you were there.<br>
You were there.<br>
<br><br>
Now I'm sitting lonely and alone this time,<br>
Not like like last time, when I was alone but with you beside me.<br>
This time, I had to go without the comfort of a final "broken good luck charm of ice cream stick"<br>
I know I'm being dramatic, who'd still feel this way after everything?<br>
Probably nobody but me, and I don't even know how to feel about that<br>
I don't know how to feel about any of it.<br> </div>
<br><br> 
But all that is selfish, and the most selfish person I have ever witnessed is nobody but me. I wish I could have been what you were to me. I wish I could once again hear "my chocolate boy" from you, I wish I could be your Mr Nice Guy, I really wish I could have been the exception you thought I am. I wish I could be what I thought I am. I just wish I could have done things the way you did for me. 
<br><br>
When it was August-september, I really hoped things would have been okay by your Birthday, now I don't know what to say about that but I also really really hoped and wished I could celebrate your birthday in a way that feels even better like last time.
Lmao you know, I'm never able to enjoy my birthday like others do, like you do, and I'm lowkey more excited about other's birthdays instead of mine. But this time you made my birthday the most special yet, reading the letter you gave me, I can't believe I'm the one being talked about there. I think even you won't believe that the person you wrote that to is me, but let's not go there. Enough depressing shit, will get back to it later.
<br><br>
HI, HAPPY BIRTHDAY BEAUTIFUL SHORT HAIR GIRL, I'm sorry for being so ugly lmao, u look a little too good. Your short hairs are fine asf.

And things I would call you "Amina appi" "Aneska_tt".<br>
Those were "THE" times for me.<br> Although things have changed a lot,<br>you were the only human in existence with whom I had the realest connection with,<br>your smile was my smile,<br>your laugh was my laugh,<br>you were the light I was the moon.<br>Good times bhai.<br>Good times.

I wish we could have been on call rn, but it's okay. <br> <br> 
I really miss those dry "yh" too <div class="image-container">

Abto I feel like I might be forgetting your the sound of your voice.  <br> 
Yk you were my partner in everything, every fucking thing, you have raised my standards a Lil too high, <br> too high ki ab tumse Kam kuch mila to kabhi uspe settle nhi ho payegen, <br> maybe that's the reason I couldn't vibe with Anupriya. Kismat bhi kitna kharab hai, tumahre jaisa insaan ko chorrna hoga ekdin, <br> tumhi bolti that "we are better off this way" and Maybe you are right, <br> but it doesn't stop me from missing you (Not like I'm intentionally doing that), <br> when I wake up or when it's late and I'm staring at my phone, <br> there is always this sudden ache in my stomach, a craving that never ends, <br> although it's normal now so it doesn't feel much, but it's still there, <br> hoping my delusions will get real. Maybe we could have been somewhere else in life today if I was Lil more mature and knew how to handle myself <br>  but again it's fine.  <br> But I hate that we are supposed to move on, heck you might even have moved on already, or maybe we are just two people chosen by God for eachother to teach eachother something, for me maybe it could be letting go of somebody even if I super-don't want to. <br> For you, well you will figure it out. Jo bhi ho. <br> I miss you, <br> I miss what we were and what we had, <br> I miss the late night sessions where you would sleep as I talk, <br> I miss the times you would call me to wake me up, <br> I miss the times where we would study together.  <br> I miss the times you would console me and treat me like a baby.

So, Magical Mystical Mishti Mushi, what are your plans for this birthday?<br>What are you gonna do?<br>Do tell me if you want to.<br>What is the nature's plan for us tho? We never know,<br>I don't know what will happen,<br>maybe our paths will cross again? That sounds so movieish lmao, it won't. <br>
Nope I haven't learnt to accept things,<br>don't know how to, I don't even know what's accepting.<br> Yeah "what's gone and what's to come is all a part of growth" and blah blah. 
<br> Khair past aur future dono ma chudaye. But for today, just know I‚Äôm thinking of you. Not just as ‚Äúyou‚Äù in the past, but the person who helped shape so much of how I think, feel, and live now. And yes I'm not the best version of me rn, I'm a dick head, but u have changed a lot in me, even after u go, the changes will keep coming up as I take super long to realise, so kind of you are a person who will shape my future too even if u go. <br><br>

I‚Äôve watched you handle things most people our age wouldn‚Äôt even know how to start with. And yet, you push through. If I had ur life I would have killed myself lol, and yet I cried so much about mine and still do. You‚Äôve grown in ways that are almost impossible to describe, but you‚Äôre stronger, wiser, and when I say ur feets and deeply attached to the roots in the soil, I mean it, because you don't change, I mean yes you do, but you change in a way that's more you, you become a deeper you and that's something I felt way before, and I think it's true, the way u are rn and the way u were a year ago, I can easily accept that yes this is you.
<br>
Yk, There‚Äôs this way you have of understanding people, like you can see past all the bullshit and get to who they are. It‚Äôs a gift, and not everyone has it. 
<br><br>
You have so much ahead of you, Anushka. Hope this next year will brings new challenges, and also bring new chances to grow, to become more of the person you‚Äôre meant to be. I know you‚Äôre going to make the most of it, you always do. 
<br><br>
I swear to god it's so tough expressing üò≠. 
<br><br>
This year, this is a wasted year and is still being wasted right infront of my eyes. You know everytime I go to mall, nucleus mall specifically, the smell there just reminds me of us going there, Last year we had our small lil farewell because we thought humlog dono alag coaching me shift hojaygen from 10th, kuch zada hi alag hogye 10th me üíÄ, khair coaching to same hi hai filhal, we used to do things before yk and have fun, everything's so dead now but it's okay atleast I got to experience it for once. that's what the so called postive side of Instagram says "Don't be sad because it ended, be grateful that it happened" pata nhi ab hum zada apply nhi kr pate, but atleast it happened. And that's great, I mean come on, how common is it nowadays to get to spend time with Anushka fucking Roy? It really is/was a privilege to be your friend. Shit man now I'm actually glad that it happened and not sad. Cool.
