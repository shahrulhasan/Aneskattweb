             Oh my God it's been a fucking year now since your last birthday. 
Ah okay 

SOO...how am I supposed to do this lmao
Okay well. 

HELLO YOU. 
Time has a way of slipping by, doesn't it? How tf are here we are again? Your birthday wasn't too long ago, feels like "are abhi to Anushka ka birthday tha"
Damn.


You probably didn‚Äôt expect this, right? Or maybe you did. I mean ofcourse you did. A letter. Not just any letter. Or maybe just another letter, who knows?

But it's something, going to be about more than just a years worth of thoughts, some we shared, some bottled up, some still hidden, too much mystry ey? I mean, it‚Äôs not every day I sit down, trying to articulate all of this, or maybe I would if it was last year, it was different back then, writing this is kind of overwhelming, my negativity kills me and eats all of me each day, but I will try and not let this chance go wasted, I really wanted to, not since a week, or a month or two but since the very exact day you turned 15, and damn I have been waiting for this. 

But it kinda sucks, sucks in a way how things have changed so much and I don't feel that freedom anymore and perhaps I don't even feel a mouth that has the right to express what I had wanted to for so long, things I wanted to earn the right to tell you. 
But hey, it's okay, I promised u right? I know I suck at promises but for today, I can go smoothly with the "One form to another"
And afterall, as you once said, ‡§ï‡•Å‡§õ ‡§¨‡§æ‡§§‡•á‡§Ç ‡§Ö‡§ß‡•Ç‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§π‡•Ä ‡§∏‡§π‡•Ä..
So it's all okay (ofc it's okay I'm telling myself it's okay ü´†) 


I'm really confused on how to start with this, feels weird and overwhelming, there are so many thoughts yet I'm able to write none, maybe let's start from the very fucking start, why don't we? (Bro won't stop acting as he's in a YouTube video)

Oh boy, so 2022 it is, 2 years ago.
We don't even know each other, all I know about you is that "Since when and how did Ayushi start looking this healthy and beautiful" like seriously that was my first thought as you already know. The first interaction I had with you was on your 14th birthday actually, I wished u happy birthday that day, we went to that school trip to sun temple, and I think that was it? 2022 me humlog kahan zada baat kiye the, but I love how my first interaction with you was on your birthday lmao.

So that means today is not just YOUR BIRTHDAY but also the 2nd anniversary of us knowing eachother, god damn I realised this so fucking late wow. 

A Happy Birthday to you and a Happy 2nd anniversary to us. (Hope that's a happy thing)

Yk sometimes I be sitting around and come to a sudden realisation every once a while. It's like "damn, she's not here" "If she would have been here it would have been like this this........."
I have lost so much :_), so much of you and so much of me as well and ig there is no getting back which is fine but damn, I have lost so much.
You saturated me yk, I was stable with you, like alkanes who don't need much of themselves, as for them hydrogen is enough. You were enough for me, nothing more, nothing less, living when you were there was easy, studying when you were there was easy, life was easy, when you were there the problems didn't matter, you always took the highlight and made my problems feel nothing, you were like home.

I was with you,
and for the first time, I existed,
beyond the air in my lungs, and the blood in my veins.

These sudden realisations are enough to give me small seizures.

Who knows what's coming next? Hate to say it but maybe one day, something or someone else will bring me the fullfilment I'm searching for, though I wouldn't prefer it be another person now. But yeah, life is just, like this endless cycle of finding fulfilment, only to loose it again

I wrote this dramatic thing while I was in the bus, sitting alone going home from bridgeford. It's very raw

It's that time of the month again,
The month I thought I had lost something I needed.
But maybe I didn't need any part of it,
It didn't matter‚Äîbecause you were there.
You were there.

Now I'm sitting lonely and alone this time,
Not like like last time, when I was alone but with you beside me.
This time, I had to go without the comfort of a final "broken good luck charm of ice cream stick"
I know I'm being dramatic, who'd still feel this way after everything?
Probably nobody but me, and I don't even know how to feel about that
I don't know how to feel about any of it.

When it was August-september, I really hoped things would have been okay by your Birthday, now I don't know what to say about that but I also really really hoped and wished I could celebrate your birthday in a way that feels even better like last time.
Lmao you know, I'm never able to enjoy my birthday like others do, like you do, and I'm lowkey more excited about other people's birthdays instead of mine. But this time you made my birthday the most special yet, reading the letter you gave me, I can't believe I'm the one being talked about there. 

Okay enough depressing shit, will get back to it later.

HI, HAPPY BIRTHDAY BEAUTIFUL SHORT HAIR GIRL, I'm sorry for being so ugly lmao, u look a little too good. Your short hairs are fine asf. 

So, short haired girl with short height (this is a joke).
How are you? Are u smiling?

You should smile, just look at this. [Insert puppet]
It's SMILING HARD


Man 2023 was so good, sure there were some issues in the end, but it was GOOD.
It was good because I met you for real this time, best person of the year ain't it? I think you might just be the best person of the decade. 
Tum kya kya nhi thi mere liye 
Literally My favourite notification
And things I would call you "Amina appi" "Aneska_tt".
Those were "THE" times for me. Although things have changed a lot, you were the only human in existence with whom I had the realest connection with, your smile was my smile, your laugh was my laugh, you were the light I was the moon. Good times bhai. Good times. You remember.

I think every teacher from the last batch of brothers would agree me and u are the best duo, or maybe not who cares (Csr does, he misses us) 
But for me, me and you were the best duo there, girl I MISS 2023 BROTHERS, loved sitting in the opposite row near you, I loved going to brothers last year, everyday I would do everything to go there no matter whatever the fuck happens, I had that rage in me that time yk, you were the one who fired that rage inside me. I'm telling you, when I say u were the light of my life, I fucking mean it. Everything is tough in the dark, chota se chota kaam pahad todne type lagta, after that's done the exhaustion I feel is literally as if hum pahad hi Tod ke aye hain. Yk that day, I came home at around 5:30 from bridgeford, it was a Tuesday, and Istg if it would have been last year, chahe kitna energy hi bacha ho, I would have done everything to go to brothers just so I could be there with you. Ab to wo motivation hi nhi Raha. Khair, last year was so fucking fun. Ssm sir jaise bhi ho, wo acche the humlog ke liye 9th me, tumko  publically address bhu kiye the, which I think was the first one to do that, giving u the "underdog" tag. That group chat too, "STUDENTS-D1", it was so fun to beef around in that group with people. Tumhare birthday hi ke din konsa to ladai hogya tha udhar pata nhi, you were worried or something üò≠ and wanted me to stay away, I was like oookayyy fir we continued with ur birthday, has to be the best day of 2023 for me. Remember we were on call till like 3am on that day? Apparantly us din Modi sarkar had a visit [ Insert modi sarkar here ] to humlog ka coaching hi band hogya tha 
Hate modi sarkar, Mera birthday pe bhi same hua.
Are bhai yaad hai, we used to discuss so much about ghosts and jinns and everything late night too. The late night discussions were PEAK literally the peak
I mean. THE PEAK [INSERT THE DEEP]
I wish we could have been on call rn, but it's okay.
I really miss those dry "yh" too [insert yh]. 
Abto I feel like I might be forgetting your the sound of your voice. 
Yk you were my partner in everything, every fucking thing, you have raised my standards a Lil too high, too high ki ab tumse Kam kuch mila to kabhi uspe settle nhi ho payegen, maybe that's the reason I couldn't vibe with Anupriya. Kismat bhi kitna kharab hai, tumahre jaisa insaan ko chorrna hoga ekdin, tumhi bolti that "we are better off this way" and Maybe you are right, but it doesn't stop me from missing you, when I wake up or when it's late and I'm staring at my phone, there is always this sudden ache in my stomach, a craving that never ends, although it's normal now so it doesn't feel much, but it's still there, hoping my delusions will get real. Maybe we could have been somewhere in life today if I was Lil more mature and knew how to handle myself, but again it's fine. But I hate that we are supposed to move on, heck you might even have moved on already, or maybe we are just two people chosen by God for eachother to teach eachother something, for me maybe it could be letting go of somebody even if I so don't want to. For you, well you will figure it out. Jo bhi ho. I miss you, I miss what we were and what we had, I miss the late night sessions where you would sleep as I talk, I miss the times you would call me to wake me up, I miss the times where we would study together.  I miss the times you would console me and treat me like a baby. I miss the times where you would actually be comfortable enough to share your problems with me. I miss the times when we were just we. I miss we.

So, Magical Mystical Mishti Mushi, what are your plans for this birthday? What are you gonna do? Do tell me if you want to. What is the nature's plan for us tho? We never know, I don't know what will happen, maybe our paths will cross again? That sounds so movieish lmao, it won't. Nope I haven't learnt to accept things, don't know how to, I don't even know what's accepting. Yeah "what's gone and what's to come is all a part of growth" and blah blah. 
Khair past aur future dono ma chudaye. But for today, just know I‚Äôm thinking of you. Not just as ‚Äúyou‚Äù in the past, but the person who helped shape so much of how I think, feel, and live now. And yes I'm not the best version of me rn, I'm a dick head, but u have changed a lot in me, even after u go, the changes will keep coming up as I take super long to realise, so kind of you are a person who will shape my future too even if u go. 

I‚Äôve watched you handle things most people our age wouldn‚Äôt even know how to start with. And yet, you push through. If I had ur life I would have killed myself lol, and yet I cry so much about mine. You‚Äôve grown in ways that are almost impossible to describe, but you‚Äôre stronger, wiser, and even more 'you' than the person I met. 

There‚Äôs this way you have of understanding people, like you can see past all the bullshit and get to who they are. It‚Äôs a gift, and not everyone has it. 

You have so much ahead of you, Anushka. Hope this next year will brings new challenges, and also bring new chances to grow, to become more of the person you‚Äôre meant to be. I know you‚Äôre going to make the most of it, you always do.
